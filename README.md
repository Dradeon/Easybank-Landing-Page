### What I learned

This project was the first time I used a CSS Framework instead of writing plain CSS. It was definitely a bit challenging to set up everything with the custom properties I wanted to use. Though, it was worth it as it made developing this landing page fast and easy as I didn't have to think about the class names for my elements and switch between the css and jsx file.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div className='relative md:max-h-[32rem] xl:max-h-[42rem]'>
          <img src='image-mockups.png' alt='mockup' className='relative bottom-20  z-10 sm:bottom-52 md:-right-56 md:bottom-24'></img>
          <img src='bg-intro-desktop.svg' className='hidden md:block absolute z-0 md:min-w-[1280px] md:-right-[54rem] md:-top-[22rem] lg:-right-[44rem] xl:-right-[36rem] -right-[36rem] '></img>
          <img src='bg-intro-mobile.svg' className='block absolute z-0 min-w-[375px] -top-6 -right-4 sm:min-w-[640px] sm:-right-8 sm:-top-20 md:hidden'></img>
</div>
```
